      Auditory persons are individuals who primarily rely on auditory
      information to understand and interpret the world around them. They tend
      to process information best when it is presented verbally or through
      sound-based means. They often have a strong auditory memory and are able
      to remember information more easily when it is presented through spoken
      words or sounds.
