      Visual persons are individuals who heavily rely on visual
      information to understand and interpret the world around them.
      They tend to process information best when it is presented visually,
      such as through images, diagrams, charts,
      graphs, or videos. They often have a strong visual
      memory and are able to recall information more easily when it is presented visually rather than verbally.
