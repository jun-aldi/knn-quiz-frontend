      Kinesthetic persons are individuals who primarily rely on physical
      movement, hands-on experiences, and tactile sensations to learn and
      process information. They learn best through active engagement and
      physical manipulation of objects or concepts. They have a strong need for
      physical interaction with their environment to fully comprehend and
      internalize information.
